# Discussion topics part 1

## General statistics:
1. The chances of somebody dying on their birthday are 13% higher than on any other day. Is this possible? Explain. Without access to a comprehensive dataset and a detailed statistical analysis, it's challenging to confirm or refute the claim that the chances of dying on one's birthday are 13% higher. It's essential to rely on credible research and statistical methods to draw meaningful conclusions about mortality patterns.



1. What does the following graph say about the test of which it represents the scores?
A graph that is going down typically indicates a decreasing trend or a decline in the scores of the test it represents.

1. The following graph tries to make the point that global warming is out of control. But what is wrong with it? The did not include the full year, and it is not representing the global warming, but only average month temperatures.

1. Under which conditions can a pie chart be used? Pie charts are best used when you want to display the relative proportions of different categories within a whole in a visually simple and intuitive way. However, it's essential to use them judiciously and consider alternative chart types when the data or the message you want to convey is more complex.
1. Explain the difference between “variation” and “covariation” with an example of our hypothetical student-grade-dataset. Variation quantifies the spread or dispersion of individual data points, while covariation measures the relationship between two variables and whether they tend to change together in a dataset.
</br> For example: Variation in study time -> Individual study times among students </br>
             Covariation between study times and scores -> This tells you whether, on average, as study time increases or decreases, test scores tend to increase or decrease as well.
1. What is the difference between a bar plot and a histogram? When do we use them? </br>  The key difference lies in the type of data they are best suited for: bar plots for categorical data and histograms for continuous data. 
1. How can you explore covariation? Are there different graphs that we can use?
Exploring covariation, or the relationship between two or more variables, is essential for understanding how changes in one variable relate to changes in another. There are various graphical methods and tools you can use to explore covariation, depending on the nature of your data and the questions you want to answer. Scatterplot, Line chart, Heatmap, Box plot, violin plot, bubble chart, 3D scatterplot
1. Explain covariance and correlation with an example. Covariance and correlation are both measures that describe the relationship between two variables in statistics. They help us understand how changes in one variable relate to changes in another. However, they have different properties and interpretations.

## Ethics in AI

1. Suppose we record all information on our students (gender, race, height, shoe size, schooling history, profession of parents, …) and use this to only allow students with a reasonable chance of succeeding to start in the first year. Would that be a good idea? Would it be an ethical idea?
(Good: something that works, that does what it is supposed to, Ethical: Being in accordance with the accepted principles of right and wrong that govern the conduct of a profession. E.g., robbing a bank is a good idea because it gets you a lot of money fast, but it isn’t an ethical idea because it is illegal and people may die.) </br> <hr>
While the goal of ensuring student success is commendable, using a wide range of personal characteristics to screen and admit students raises significant ethical concerns related to fairness, discrimination, privacy, and inclusivity. It is essential to strike a balance between identifying students who may benefit from additional support and respecting the principles of fairness and equal opportunity. Any admission criteria should be well-justified, evidence-based, and applied in a way that promotes both academic excellence and ethical principles.
</br>
1. Suppose we record all school-related information on our students (class attendance, exam results, how long they studied, …) and compare this with the results of students finishing the first year, it would give us an insight in their chances of finishing our program in a timely fashion.
What if we forbid students that we think would not finish or take more than 4 years to continue in our program. Would that be a good/ethical idea?
What if we wouldn’t forbid them, but simply gave them a very strong warning (unless you dramatically change some of these parameters, you won’t be finishing this program according to the data). Would that be a good/ethical idea? </br> <hr>
The decision to forbid students or provide strong warnings based on predictive data should be made carefully, considering the ethical principles of fairness, transparency, and individuality. Forbidding students solely based on predictions without considering their potential and unique circumstances may not align with ethical principles. Providing warnings, along with support and resources for improvement, can be a more ethical approach, recognizing the possibility of growth and considering the well-being of students.

## Group forming

1. Let everyone in your group take a random personality test (Enneagram, Typefinder or MBTI, Big Five Assessment, Career Profiler, Workplace DISC Test, …). Compare these totally unrelated results.
1. Generate a couple of random roles using https://www.randomlists.com/random-jobs (you can rerun as much as necessary). Assign all team members a role with description of tasks.
1. The three of you start a company that specializes in data management. Think of a name. Write (or let some AI generate) a company introduction and mission statement.
1. Use another AI-model to generate a company image, preferably something that is reflected in your company name.
1. Create a markdown file with your company information, a professional picture of every one of you along with your job title and tasks. Upload this in your github as “README.md” and post the link to the repo in the team chat you made that included the instructor.

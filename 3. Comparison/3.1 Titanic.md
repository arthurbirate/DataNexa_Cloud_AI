# Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models for Titanic Dataset


<h3> Introduction </h3>


<p>In the field of machine learning, the Titanic dataset is frequently utilized and provides a great standard for comparing various categorization systems. This paper compares three machine learning models—Pycaret's Gradient Boosting Classifier, Scikit-learn's HistGradient Boosting Classifier, and AWS's XGBoost—that were trained on the Titanic dataset. These models' performances will be assessed and contrasted according to their accuracy criteria. </p>




<h3> Data overview</h3>

<p> The Titanic dataset includes passenger characteristics including age, sex, class, and ticket price in addition to the goal variable, which shows whether a passenger survived (1) or not (0).  </p>



<h2>Model Evaluation</h2>

<h3>Scikit-learn with HistGradientBoostingClassifier</h3>


<p> * Accuracy: <b>83%</b> </p>

<p> Using the Titanic dataset, the accuracy of the scikit-learn model was 83%. This indicates that a fairly high level of predicted accuracy was achieved using the Gradient Boosting Classifier combined with scikit-learn's automation. </p>
